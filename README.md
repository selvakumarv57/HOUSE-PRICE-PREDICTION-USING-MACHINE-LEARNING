# PREDICTING-HOUSE-PRICES-USING-MACHINE LEARNING

This project is a simple implementation of a house price prediction model using machine learning in Python. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

**Dependencies**

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x

NumPy

pandas

scikit-learn

Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

**How to Run the Code:**

**1.Clone the Repository**

**git clone https://github.com/selvakumarv57/HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING.git**

cd HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING

**2.Prepare the Data**


**Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing**

Place your house price data in a CSV file (e.g., house_prices.csv) in the project directory. Make sure the CSV file contains features (X) and the target variable (y).

**Run the Jupyter Notebook**

The main code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook. To run it, execute the following command:

**jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb**

This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your web browser.

**Execute the Notebook**

Open the house_price_prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and execute each cell step by step. This notebook contains all the code, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

This project was created as a learning exercise and is based on various machine learning tutorials and courses.

**Description**
The dataset contains information about various attributes related to residential properties. It's commonly used for regression tasks to predict the sale prices of houses based on a variety of features. Here are some of the key features in the dataset:

MSSubClass: The building class.

LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to the property.

LotArea:  Lot size in square feet.

OverallQual:  Overall material and finish quality.

YearBuilt:  Original construction date.

TotalBsmtSF: Total square feet of basement area.

GrLivArea: Above-ground living area square feet.

FullBath: Number of full bathrooms.

BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms above ground.

GarageCars: Size of garage in car capacity.

SalePrice: The target variable, the sale price of the house.

Feature 1: Description of feature 1.

Feature 2: Description of feature 2.
...

Price: The target variable, representing the sale price of the houses.

This dataset is commonly used for house price prediction tasks, and it's suitable for practicing regression techniques and feature engineering.
